            Hair wasn’t always my passion. When I started cosmetology school in 2003, it was out of necessity to provide for my young family. There I discovered my love for spending my days doing something creative and connecting with people. I’ve been a licensed cosmetologist since 2005.

            I started Hair Bar in 2014 in a 150 square foot studio inside Sola Salons. I loved my little studio and the freedom it gave me to run my own business. In 2019, I had outgrown that space, and found a perfect spot in the heart of Middletown to expand. My husband and I spent months turning the red, concrete basement unit into what it is today. My goal is to continue to grow Hair Bar into a place clients will enjoy spending their time and leaving feeling like the best version of themselves.

            As a stylist, I put a lot of emphasis on continuing my education in this ever-evolving industry, focusing on custom coloring and wedding day beauty. I attend classes both locally and nationally and have been educated by some of the top artists in the industry. Attending events like this always reignites my passion behind the chair and gets me excited to learn more!

            I am a mother to 3 awesome boys, 3 needy dogs, and a cat, and married to an amazing partner that is always supportive of all of my big (and crazy) ideas. In my free time, I like to run and participate in triathlons (yes, I think they're fun!) and be with my family out in nature.
